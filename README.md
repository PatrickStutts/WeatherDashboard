<h2>A Fix For Your Weather Worries<h2>
<br> 
<h4>Description<h4>
<p>
In our weather dashboard app you can get the run down on your current city and any where you wish to travel. The user can simply type in the name of a city and we will fetch the info from our openweathermapAPI.
<p>
<h4>Purpose<h4>
<p> 
This assignment was meant to build my skills in using a third-party API source to fetch data for my app to use.
