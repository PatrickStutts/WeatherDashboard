# WeatherDashboard

A Fix For Your Weather Worries
 
Description

In our weather dashboard app you can get the run down on your current city and any where you wish to travel. The user can simply type in the name of a city and we will fetch the info from our openweathermapAPI.

Purpose
 
This assignment was meant to build my skills in using a third-party API source to fetch data for my app to use.
